# Sozo Behavioral Intelligence Report
## Pure Freedom Ministries / True Girl Brand
### Microsegmentation Analysis for Campaign Planning

**Generated:** February 2025
**Data Source:** sozov2 (unified pipeline — 84,507 contacts, 14 serving tables)
**Prepared for:** Leadership & Development Team

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pure Freedom Ministries has **84,507 known contacts**, but only **5,030 have ever donated** (6% donor conversion rate). The organization generates **$7.1M in lifetime giving** from an increasingly concentrated donor base. Meanwhile, **29,220 people have purchased products but never donated**, representing a $2.4M commerce relationship with zero philanthropic engagement.

### The Five Critical Findings

1. **Donor Concentration Risk**: 76 major donors ($10K+) contribute **67% of all giving** ($4.4M). Only 369 donors are currently active (gave in last 6 months).

2. **Massive Conversion Opportunity**: 40,498 people are "highly engaged" (30-100 tags) but only 7.6% have ever donated. Converting even 5% more would add 2,000+ donors.

3. **Subscription Box Collapse**: Only **41 of 6,337 subscriptions remain active** (0.6% retention). The subscription box product has functionally failed and needs a complete relaunch strategy.

4. **Lost Recurring Revenue**: 383 recurring donors were lost in the Kindful→Givebutter migration, representing **$17,127/month ($205K/year)** in lost MRR.

5. **Wealth Gap**: 1,109 wealth-screened contacts have **$50M+ in untapped giving capacity**. The Ultra High tier (29 people) averages $817K capacity but only $20K actual giving.

## PART 1: DONOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Donor Universe Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total contacts | 84,507 |
| Ever donated | 5,030 (6.0%) |
| Active donors (last 6 mo) | 369 (0.4%) |
| Cooling donors (6-12 mo) | 420 |
| Lapsed donors (1-2 yr) | 1,093 |
| Lost donors (2+ yr) | 3,155 |
| Lifetime giving | $6,511,556 |
| Average gift (all time) | $98 |

### 1.2 Donor Frequency Segments

| Segment | Donors | % | Total Given | Avg LTV | Avg Gift |
|---------|--------|---|-------------|---------|----------|
| One-Time | 2,913 | 58% | $130,216 | $44 | $44 |
| Occasional (2-3) | 836 | 17% | $241,978 | $289 | $114 |
| Regular (4-11) | 383 | 8% | $550,990 | $1,438 | $215 |
| Committed (12+) | 898 | 18% | $5,588,372 | $6,223 | $141 |

**Key Insight:** 58% of donors gave only once. The committed 18% generate **86% of all revenue**. The path from one-time → occasional is the single most impactful conversion to target.

### 1.3 Lifetime Giving Tiers

| Tier | Donors | Total Given | Avg Gifts | Avg Recency (days) |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Micro (<$25) | 2,227 | $27,467 | 1 | 955 |
| Entry ($25-$100) | 1,364 | $56,144 | 1 | 894 |
| Developing ($100-$500) | 476 | $99,479 | 6 | 708 |
| Growing ($500-$1K) | 209 | $146,927 | 24 | 919 |
| Core ($1K-$5K) | 629 | $1,461,326 | 69 | 544 |
| Mid-Major ($5K-$10K) | 49 | $344,179 | 70 | 493 |
| Major ($10K+) | 76 | $4,376,034 | 67 | 354 |

**Key Insight:** The Core tier (629 donors, $1K-$5K) is the "sweet spot" — high LTV, high engagement (69 avg gifts), and most recent activity (544 days avg). Mid-Major and Major tiers are even more engaged. The Growing tier ($500-$1K) has concerning 919-day recency — these donors are slipping away.

### 1.4 RFM Matrix (Recency x Frequency)

| Recency | Frequency | Donors | Total Value | Avg LTV |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Active (0-6mo)** | Committed | 350 | $2,244,991 | $6,414 |
| **Active (0-6mo)** | Regular | 16 | $4,330 | $270 |
| **Cooling (6-12mo)** | Committed | 100 | $1,928,838 | **$19,288** |
| Cooling (6-12mo) | Regular | 80 | $239,516 | $2,993 |
| Cooling (6-12mo) | Occasional | 54 | $91,185 | $1,688 |
| Cooling (6-12mo) | One-Time | 185 | $7,826 | $42 |
| Lapsing (1-2yr) | Committed | 127 | $873,261 | $6,876 |
| Lapsing (1-2yr) | Regular | 126 | $188,844 | $1,498 |
| Lapsing (1-2yr) | Occasional | 196 | $73,906 | $377 |
| Lapsing (1-2yr) | One-Time | 639 | $30,334 | $47 |
| **Lapsed (2yr+)** | Committed | 321 | $541,280 | $1,686 |
| Lapsed (2yr+) | Regular | 161 | $118,299 | $734 |
| Lapsed (2yr+) | Occasional | 584 | $76,716 | $131 |
| Lapsed (2yr+) | One-Time | 2,088 | $92,036 | $44 |

**Priority Cells (highest urgency):**
1. **Cooling + Committed (100 donors, $19,288 avg LTV)**: These are your BEST donors going quiet. Immediate personal outreach needed.
2. **Lapsing + Committed (127 donors, $6,876 avg LTV)**: High-value donors drifting away. Re-engagement campaign critical.
3. **Cooling + Regular (80 donors, $2,993 avg LTV)**: Mid-tier donors at risk. Stewardship touches needed.

### 1.5 Yearly Giving Trends

| Year | Donors | Gifts | Total | Avg Gift |
|------|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| 2018 | 493 | 4,693 | $340,362 | $72 |
| 2019 | 762 | 6,511 | $539,232 | $82 |
| 2020 | 1,219 | 9,949 | $621,085 | $62 |
| 2021 | 1,237 | 9,279 | $729,685 | $78 |
| 2022 | 2,293 | 9,468 | $837,022 | $88 |
| 2023 | 2,158 | 7,939 | $1,059,196 | $133 |
| 2024 | 1,723 | 7,318 | **$1,413,193** | **$193** |
| 2025* | 888 | 5,235 | $798,697 | $152 |

*2025 partial year (through ~Feb 2025)

**Key Insight:** Revenue is growing despite FEWER donors. Average gift has nearly tripled ($62 → $193) since 2020. This means you're increasingly dependent on fewer, larger donors — a sustainability risk.

### 1.6 Giving Seasonality

| Month | Donors | Gifts | Total | Avg Gift |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Jan | 1,043 | 5,033 | $404,103 | $80 |
| Feb | 856 | 4,432 | $355,127 | $80 |
| Mar | 779 | 4,463 | $382,453 | $85 |
| Apr | 1,098 | 5,271 | $373,268 | $70 |
| May | 1,149 | 5,177 | $405,159 | $78 |
| Jun | 817 | 4,563 | $412,627 | $90 |
| Jul | 1,188 | 5,227 | $397,534 | $76 |
| Aug | 780 | 4,364 | $308,095 | $70 |
| Sep | 1,081 | 5,249 | $433,989 | $82 |
| Oct | 789 | 4,421 | $395,866 | $89 |
| Nov | 859 | 5,195 | $573,989 | $110 |
| **Dec** | **1,577** | **12,999** | **$1,669,346** | **$128** |

**Key Insight:** December generates **25% of annual revenue** with the highest donor count. November-December combined = 34%. Spring (Apr-May) shows a secondary peak driven by tour season marketing.

### 1.7 First Gift Distribution

| First Gift Range | Donors |
|-----------------|--------|
| $1-$10 | 2,370 |
| $10-$25 | 1,077 |
| $25-$50 | 621 |
| $50-$100 | 352 |
| $100-$250 | 184 |
| $250+ | 420 |

**Key Insight:** 69% of first gifts are under $25. The $250+ first-gift segment (420 people) likely represents major gift prospects who entered at a high level — track their retention carefully.

### 1.8 Payment Methods

| Method | Gifts | Donors | Total |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| PCC (pre-auth card) | 55,287 | 4,150 | $4,246,772 |
| CK (check) | 1,263 | 132 | $1,494,062 |
| Card | 1,531 | 352 | $564,701 |
| CC (credit card) | 3,507 | 595 | $320,926 |
| EFT (bank transfer) | 608 | 77 | $199,554 |
| Givebutter (PKIND) | 1,935 | 300 | $73,647 |
| Keap (PKEAP) | 2,193 | 975 | $63,527 |

**Key Insight:** Check donors (132 people) give **$11,318 average** vs. $1,024 for PCC card donors. Check writers are your major gift segment — they need personal stewardship, not email campaigns.

### 1.9 Geographic Concentration (Top 10 States)

Top giving states by total revenue are concentrated in the Northeast/Midwest corridor near the ministry's PA headquarters. This geographic data can inform regional event planning and local stewardship visits.

### 1.10 Donor Upgrade/Downgrade Trends

| Year | New | Upgraded | Stable | Downgraded |
|------|-----|----------|--------|------------|
| 2022 | 2,294 | — | — | — |
| 2023 | 1,302 | 305 | 418 | 231 |
| 2024 | 738 | 296 | 352 | 283 |
| 2025* | 521 | 160 | 147 | 79 |

**Key Insight:** New donor acquisition has dropped 68% (2,294 → 738) from 2022-2024. The upgrade/downgrade ratio is healthy (~1:1), but the shrinking new-donor pipeline is the biggest strategic risk.

---

## PART 2: SUBSCRIPTION BOX & COMMERCE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Subscription Product Breakdown

| Product | Total | Active | Churned | Retention | Avg Price |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Physical Monthly: 1 Girl | 4,672 | 13 | 4,659 | 0.3% | $30 |
| Physical Monthly: 2 Girls | 437 | 8 | 429 | 1.8% | $55 |
| Physical Monthly: 3+ Girls | 242 | 0 | 242 | 0.0% | $75-$120 |
| Digital Subscription | 249 | 18 | 231 | 7.2% | $10-$20 |
| Other products | 737 | 2 | 735 | 0.3% | varies |

**Key Insight:** The subscription box has experienced **catastrophic churn** — only 41 of 6,337 subscriptions remain active (0.6%). This was likely caused by the platform migration (Keap → new system). Digital subscriptions retained slightly better (7.2%) suggesting the physical fulfillment/billing transition was the primary failure point.

### 2.2 Subscriber-Donor Crossover

| Status | Subscription Status | Subscribers | Avg Giving |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Also a Donor | Active | 27 | $739 |
| Also a Donor | Inactive | 1,038 | **$3,641** |
| Never Donated | Active | 14 | $0 |
| Never Donated | Inactive | 4,735 | $0 |

**Key Insight:** 81% of subscribers (4,749 of 5,814) have NEVER donated. But churned subscribers who DID donate gave an average of **$3,641** — they're high-value constituents. The 1,038 inactive subscriber-donors are a prime reactivation segment.

### 2.3 Commerce Buyer Segments

| Segment | Buyers | Avg Spend | Avg Orders |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Single Buyer | 19,205 | $58 | 1 |
| Repeat (2-5) | 7,323 | $112 | 2 |
| Loyal (6-20) | 4,424 | $242 | 11 |
| VIP (20+) | 2,742 | $608 | 41 |

**Key Insight:** 33,694 unique buyers. VIP buyers (2,742) averaging 41 orders and $608 spent are deeply engaged with the brand — prime donor conversion targets.

### 2.4 Buyers Who Never Donated

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total unique buyers | 33,694 |
| **Buyers who NEVER donated** | **29,220 (87%)** |
| Commerce spend from non-donors | **$2,363,432** |

**This is the single largest untapped opportunity.** 29,220 people have pulled out their credit card to buy True Girl products but have never been converted to donors. They already trust the brand enough to spend money — a donation ask is a natural next step.

### 2.5 Triple Overlap Analysis

| Category | People |
|----------|--------|
| Donor + Buyer + Subscriber | 1,058 |
| Buyer + Subscriber (no donation) | 4,745 |
| Subscriber Only | 1 |

**Key Insight:** Almost all subscribers are also buyers (through Keap commerce). The 4,745 who are buyer+subscriber but NOT donors are the warmest possible audience for a giving campaign — they've demonstrated two forms of financial commitment already.

### 2.6 Lost Recurring Donors

| Category | Donors | Monthly MRR | Annual Value |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Active (lost tokens) | 317 | $14,364 | $172,368 |
| Cancelled | 66 | $2,762 | $33,150 |
| **Total** | **383** | **$17,127** | **$205,518** |

**Key Insight:** $205K/year in recurring giving was lost in the Kindful→Givebutter migration. 317 donors had their payment tokens lost ("active" but can't process). A recovery campaign for these specific donors — with a personal apology and easy re-enrollment — could recapture significant recurring revenue.

### 2.7 Subscription Price Sensitivity

| Price Range | Total | Active | Retention |
|-------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| $0-$20 | 249 | 18 | 7.2% |
| $20-$35 | 4,734 | 13 | 0.3% |
| $35-$50 | 20 | 0 | 0.0% |
| $50-$100 | 438 | 8 | 1.8% |
| $100+ | 896 | 2 | 0.2% |

**Key Insight:** The $20-$35 range (the core $30/month 1-Girl box) has the worst retention. The cheapest tier ($0-$20, likely digital) retains best. For relaunch, consider a lower entry price point or digital-first approach.

### 2.8 Stripe Payment Analysis

| Status | Customers | Total Spend | Avg Spend |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Linked to Identity | 3,292 | $721,073 | $219 |
| **Unlinked** | **3,474** | **$1,265,114** | **$364** |

**Key Insight:** 3,474 Stripe customers ($1.27M in spend) are NOT linked to any identity in the system. The unlinked customers actually spend MORE per person ($364 vs $219). Email matching could recover many of these relationships.

## PART 3: ENGAGEMENT & TAG ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Tag Universe Overview

The system contains **2,973,999 tag assignments** across **41 distinct tag groups** and **84,507 people**. Tags represent marketing touchpoints, program participation, tour attendance, and donor status.

### 3.2 Major Program Participation (Tag Groups)

| Program/Group | People | Tags |
|---------------|--------|------|
| True Girl | 64,569 | 103,517 |
| Fix Your Funnel | 59,290 | 123,099 |
| True Productions | 49,596 | 132,933 |
| Nurture Tags | 45,541 | 207,386 |
| Memberships | 33,172 | 50,939 |
| Customer Tags | 32,592 | 74,920 |
| Lies Moms Believe | 28,088 | 30,219 |
| Spring 2025 CHT Marketing | 24,872 | 24,872 |
| Donor Assignment | 17,939 | 90,457 |
| B2BB (Born to Be Brave) | 9,752 | 19,304 |
| Dannah Gresh | 9,172 | 9,252 |
| Subscription Box tags | ~8,000 | ~24,000 |
| Tour Marketing (all seasons) | ~45,000 | ~106,000 |

### 3.3 Engagement Depth vs Donor Conversion

| Engagement Level | People | Donors | Donor % | Avg Giving | Avg Orders |
|-----------------|--------|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Super (100+ tags) | 2,272 | 1,512 | **66.5%** | $5,424 | 13 |
| High (30-100 tags) | 40,498 | 3,064 | 7.6% | $26 | 1 |
| Moderate (10-30 tags) | 25,362 | 312 | 1.2% | $2 | 0 |
| Light (1-10 tags) | 13,193 | 33 | 0.3% | $0 | 0 |
| No Tags | 3,170 | 116 | 3.7% | $34 | 0 |

**Key Insight:** There is a DRAMATIC cliff between "Super Engaged" (66.5% donor rate, $5,424 avg giving) and "Highly Engaged" (7.6%, $26). The **37,434 highly-engaged non-donors** are the prime conversion audience. They've opened emails, attended events, engaged with content — but haven't been asked to give in the right way.

### 3.4 Lifecycle Stage Engagement Profile

| Stage | People | Avg Tags | Avg Notes | Avg Comms | Avg Orders | Avg Giving |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Prospect | 79,458 | 32 | 3 | 0 | 1 | $0 |
| Lost (2yr+) | 3,155 | 79 | 14 | 0 | 4 | $516 |
| Lapsed (1-2yr) | 1,093 | 78 | 11 | 4 | 7 | $2,265 |
| Cooling (6-12mo) | 420 | 76 | 12 | 10 | 9 | $10,867 |
| Active (0-6mo) | 369 | 138 | 22 | 30 | 7 | $13,259 |

**Key Insight:** Active donors have 138 avg tags and 30 avg communications — they're deeply embedded in the ecosystem. Cooling donors (420) have similar tag counts but communication drops to 10 — the relationship is fading. Re-engagement communications are the lever.

### 3.5 True Girl Program Tags (Top Insights)

| Tag | Assignments |
|-----|------------|
| True Girl (general) | 64,538 |
| TG Power Pack | 31,297 |
| True Girl Global - Registered | 1,114 |
| True Girl - Devo | 994 |
| True Girl Nation (Kindful) | 917 |
| True Girl Subscription Box SMS | 130 |
| True Girl Donation | 186 |

**Key Insight:** 64,538 people are tagged as True Girl engaged, but only 186 have a "True Girl Donation" tag. The TG Power Pack (31,297 people) is a massive email list that represents the core True Girl audience.

### 3.6 B2BB (Bible Study) Tags

| Tag | Assignments |
|-----|------------|
| Born to Be Brave | 9,737 |
| B2BB Tour 2025 Marketing | 7,435 |
| B2BB Only | 2,070 |
| B2BB Box Receipt Email | 35 |
| Brave Box Recurring | 27 |

**Key Insight:** B2BB reaches 9,752 people. Tour marketing (7,435) is the primary driver. The "B2BB Only" segment (2,070) represents people engaged with Bible study content but NOT with True Girl — a distinct audience for targeted campaigns.

### 3.7 Tour Marketing Reach

| Tour Season | Assignments |
|-------------|------------|
| Spring 2023 Pajama Party (Marketing) | 18,329 |
| Fall 2022 Pajama Party (Marketing) | 12,167 |
| Spring 2024 Crazy Hair Tour | 11,402 |
| Pajama Party Tour 2022 | 10,676 |
| Spring 2024 Crazy Hair Purchase | 9,918 |
| Fall 2023 Crazy Hair Marketing | 9,558 |
| Fall 2023 B2BB Tour Marketing | 8,592 |
| Spring 2023 PP Tour Purchase | 7,760 |
| Spring 2025 CHT Purchased | 7,907 |

**Key Insight:** Tours drive massive engagement — the Pajama Party and Crazy Hair tours reached 10,000-18,000 people per season. Tour marketing is the organization's strongest acquisition channel.

### 3.8 Nurture Campaign Performance

| Campaign | Assignments |
|----------|------------|
| Master Class Marketing 2023 | 37,107 |
| BFF Workshop 2023 | 33,032 |
| Living Happily Even After Workshop | 25,364 |
| TG Global 2023 | 23,913 |
| Miriam Live Bible Study | 22,298 |
| Guilt-Free Mom Workshop | 20,131 |
| Lies We Believe About Sex Bible Study | 18,225 |
| Post-Tour Subscription Box Sale | 8,381 |
| Subscription Free Trial Opt-In | 4,659 |

**Key Insight:** Workshop/Bible study marketing campaigns reach 18,000-37,000 people each. These are warm audiences who've opted into content. The subscription box upsell campaigns (8,381 post-tour + 4,659 free trial) show the sales funnel that was driving box growth before the migration collapse.

### 3.9 Top Engaged Non-Donors (Individual Conversion Targets)

The top 20 most engaged people who have NEVER donated:

| Name | Tags | Notes | Comms | Orders | Commerce Spend |
|------|------|-------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Leendah Adaka | 258 | 54 | 17 | 38 | $4,690 |
| Lisa Arroyo | 150 | 74 | 6 | 13 | $6,315 |
| Donna Stephens | 200 | 54 | 0 | 5 | $92 |
| Jackey Geeslin | 223 | 29 | 1 | 4 | $247 |
| Sara Ghioto | 236 | 15 | 0 | 0 | $0 |
| Ashley Butler | 191 | 45 | 0 | 8 | $353 |
| k-lee pinto | 183 | 40 | 0 | 18 | $233 |
| Lynn Schuler | 199 | 22 | 0 | 27 | $577 |
| ... (20 total) | | | | | |

These individuals have 150-258 tag touches with the organization. Lisa Arroyo has $6,315 in commerce spend and 74 notes but $0 in donations. A personal ask from a known team member would be the most effective approach.

### 3.10 Wealth Capacity Gap

| Tier | Screened | Are Donors | Avg Capacity | Avg Actual | Avg Gap |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Ultra High ($250K+) | 29 | 27 | $817,852 | $20,331 | **$797,520** |
| Very High ($100K-$250K) | 114 | 110 | $144,324 | $15,579 | $128,744 |
| High ($25K-$100K) | 391 | 376 | $43,930 | $3,201 | $40,728 |
| Medium ($10K-$25K) | 178 | 170 | $18,391 | $1,152 | $17,238 |
| Standard | 397 | 382 | $5,076 | $1,510 | $3,565 |

**Key Insight:** Across all tiers, actual giving is **2-5% of estimated capacity**. The Ultra High tier alone represents $23M in untapped capacity (29 people x $797K avg gap). Even a modest increase in giving from this tier would dwarf any other campaign.

## PART 4: MICROSEGMENTATION FRAMEWORK

Based on the behavioral data, we define **15 actionable microsegments** organized by strategic priority.

### TIER 1: HIGHEST IMPACT (Revenue Protection & Growth)

#### Segment 1: "Cooling Champions" — 100 people
**Definition:** Committed donors (12+ gifts) with last gift 6-12 months ago
**Value:** $19,288 avg LTV, $1.93M total value at risk
**Behavior:** Were giving regularly, suddenly stopped. Average 76 tags, 12 notes.
**Campaign:** Personal phone calls from leadership. Handwritten thank-you + impact report. "We miss you" is the wrong message — "Here's what your giving accomplished" is right.
**Goal:** Reactivate 60% within 90 days

#### Segment 2: "Lapsing Loyalists" — 127 people
**Definition:** Committed donors (12+ gifts) with last gift 1-2 years ago
**Value:** $6,876 avg LTV, $873K total
**Behavior:** Deep history with the organization but drifting away. 78 avg tags.
**Campaign:** Multi-touch re-engagement: personalized video from Dannah → impact report → specific ask tied to a program they were connected to (True Girl, B2BB).
**Goal:** Reactivate 30% within 6 months

#### Segment 3: "Lost Legends" — 321 people
**Definition:** Committed donors (12+ gifts) who lapsed 2+ years ago
**Value:** $1,686 avg LTV, $541K total
**Behavior:** Were once deeply committed but fell off. May have life changes or lost connection.
**Campaign:** "Reconnect" campaign — survey to understand why they stopped, updated ministry impact stories, low-barrier re-entry ask ($25/month).
**Goal:** Reactivate 15% within 12 months

#### Segment 4: "Wealth Gap Champions" — 29 people
**Definition:** Ultra High capacity ($250K+) with actual giving far below capacity
**Value:** $797K avg untapped capacity per person
**Behavior:** 27 of 29 are already donors. They give — just not proportionally to capacity.
**Campaign:** Major gift officer personal cultivation. Event invitations, ministry tours, naming opportunities. These require 1-on-1 relationship building, not mass campaigns.
**Goal:** Secure 3-5 major gift upgrades ($50K+) within 18 months

### TIER 2: CONVERSION OPPORTUNITIES

#### Segment 5: "Engaged Non-Donors (Super)" — 760 people
**Definition:** 100+ tags, zero donations, from the 2,272 super-engaged pool
**Value:** Potential $5,424 LTV (based on similar engaged-donor behavior)
**Behavior:** 66.5% of super-engaged people DO donate. These 760 are the ones who don't — but they have deep engagement.
**Campaign:** Personalized first-ask tied to their specific engagement (True Girl mom? B2BB participant? Tour attendee?). Include a low-barrier entry: "$15/month supports one girl."
**Goal:** Convert 25% to first-time donors

#### Segment 6: "Highly Engaged Non-Donors" — 37,434 people
**Definition:** 30-100 tags, zero donations
**Value:** Only 7.6% conversion rate currently. Moving to 12% = 1,650 new donors.
**Behavior:** Regular email openers, event registrants, content consumers. They love the brand but haven't been effectively asked to give.
**Campaign:** Segmented email series by program affinity (True Girl vs. B2BB vs. Dannah content). Donation ask embedded in content they already consume. A/B test: story-led vs. impact-metric-led asks.
**Goal:** Convert 5% to first-time donors (1,872 new donors)

#### Segment 7: "VIP Buyers, Zero Giving" — estimated 2,000+ people
**Definition:** Buyers with 20+ orders AND $0 donations
**Value:** $608 avg commerce spend. Already spending money with PFM.
**Behavior:** Loyal customers who buy products for their daughters but don't see the ministry as a giving opportunity.
**Campaign:** "Did you know?" campaign explaining the nonprofit mission behind the products. Product insert with donation ask. Post-purchase thank-you email with soft ask.
**Goal:** Convert 10% to first-time donors

#### Segment 8: "Subscriber-Donors (Inactive)" — 1,038 people
**Definition:** Had a subscription box + have donated, but subscription is now inactive
**Value:** $3,641 avg giving — these are high-value constituents
**Behavior:** Were deeply engaged (subscription + donations), now lapsed on subscriptions. May still be giving.
**Campaign:** Subscription box relaunch invitation with "founding member" status. Bundle: subscription + monthly giving auto-enrollment.
**Goal:** Re-enroll 15% in new subscription program

### TIER 3: PROGRAM-SPECIFIC GROWTH

#### Segment 9: "True Girl Moms" — ~64,000 people
**Definition:** Anyone tagged with True Girl program engagement
**Behavior:** The largest single audience. True Girl Power Pack alone has 31,297 people.
**Campaign Strategy:**
- **Bible Study track:** Promote B2BB and other studies to TG-engaged moms (only 9,752 currently in B2BB). Cross-sell message: "Loved True Girl tours? Go deeper with B2BB Bible study."
- **Subscription track:** Relaunch subscription box targeting TG Power Pack list
- **Giving track:** "Freedom Partner" recurring giving program promoted through TG content

#### Segment 10: "B2BB Only" — 2,070 people
**Definition:** Engaged with B2BB Bible study but NOT with True Girl
**Value:** Distinct audience — likely different demographic (may not have daughters in TG age range)
**Campaign:** Bible study-focused content. Promote new study releases, small group resources. Donation ask tied to Bible study impact: "Your gift puts Bible studies in the hands of families who can't afford them."
**Goal:** Cross-sell to True Girl products/events where appropriate, convert to donors

#### Segment 11: "Tour Attendees (Never Returned)" — estimated 8,000-12,000
**Definition:** Marketing tag for any tour season but no purchase tag for subsequent seasons
**Behavior:** Were marketed to for a tour, possibly attended once, but didn't come back.
**Campaign:** Early-bird pricing for next tour season. "Bring a friend" discount. Post-event follow-up content series to maintain engagement between tour seasons.

### TIER 4: RECOVERY & REACTIVATION

#### Segment 12: "Lost Recurring Donors" — 383 people
**Definition:** Recurring donors lost in Kindful→Givebutter migration
**Value:** $17,127/month = $205K/year
**Campaign:** Personal outreach acknowledging the disruption. Simple re-enrollment link. Incentive: first month matched 2:1 by a matching donor.
**Goal:** Recover $8,000/month (47%) within 6 months

#### Segment 13: "One-Time Donor Reactivation" — 2,913 people
**Definition:** Gave exactly once, never again
**Value:** $44 avg gift. Small individually but massive in aggregate.
**Behavior:** 58% of all donors! Most gave a micro gift (<$25) and were never properly followed up.
**Campaign:** Automated welcome series for new donors (prevent future one-and-done). For existing one-timers: "Your $25 gift last year did [specific impact]. Would you give again today?" Segment by recency — prioritize those within 2 years.
**Goal:** Reactivate 10% of those within 2 years (186 donors)

#### Segment 14: "Unlinked Stripe Customers" — 3,474 people
**Definition:** Stripe payment records that can't be matched to a contact identity
**Value:** $1.27M total spend, $364 avg
**Campaign:** Technical — run email matching against the broader contact database. For those matched, integrate into appropriate segments above. For unmatched, build a separate re-engagement campaign through Stripe's own email capabilities.
**Goal:** Link 50% to existing identities

#### Segment 15: "Growing Tier at Risk" — 209 people
**Definition:** $500-$1K lifetime giving, but 919-day avg recency (2.5 years!)
**Value:** $146,927 total, 24 avg gifts per person — these WERE regular givers
**Behavior:** Crossed the $500 threshold through consistent small gifts, then stopped.
**Campaign:** Acknowledge their cumulative impact: "Over the years, your faithful giving of $X has [impact]. We'd love to welcome you back." This group responds to consistency messaging, not urgency.
**Goal:** Reactivate 20% within 12 months

## APPENDIX: DATA QUALITY NOTES

1. **Donation deduplication:** Givebutter mirrors Donor Direct — deduplicated in pipeline to prevent double-counting
2. **Fund/Appeal data:** Not available in current donation records (all NULL). If fund codes are added to future imports, segmentation by cause becomes possible.
3. **Tour registration data:** Referenced in board report (16,361 registrations) but not found in any database or file storage. If available, would significantly enhance engagement tracking.
4. **Bloomerang data:** Only Stripe migration artifacts exist (payment tokens). No CRM donor records from Bloomerang are available.
5. **Tag group = NULL:** 1.8M of 3M tag assignments have no group classification. These are Keap marketing automation tags that could be reclassified for deeper analysis.
6. **Identity resolution:** 84,507 unique contacts after cross-system deduplication. Some contacts may still be duplicates (different email addresses, same person).

## 2. THE 25 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### GIVING & DONOR HEALTH

**Insight #1: Donor Retention Has Collapsed**
Year-over-year donor retention dropped from **74.1% (2020) to 33.3% (2024)**. The nonprofit sector average is 40-45%. This means two-thirds of donors who give in any year do not give the following year. The collapse began in 2022 — coinciding with the platform migration from Kindful. This single metric represents the organization's most urgent strategic crisis.

**Insight #2: Revenue Is Growing But the Foundation Is Crumbling**
Annual giving grew from $621K (2020) to $1.41M (2024) — a 127% increase. But this growth came from **fewer donors giving larger gifts**, not from broadening the base. Average gift tripled from $62 to $193. The organization is building a taller building on a narrower foundation. One major donor loss could collapse annual revenue by 10-15%.

**Insight #3: 6 of the Top 10 Donors Are At Risk**
Of the 10 largest lifetime donors ($197K-$1.6M each):
- **4 are Active** (Whitman, Johnson, Nicholson, Laskin)
- **5 are Cooling** (Lampe $1.6M, Fletcher $766K, Stober $451K, Cohen $246K, Jones $220K)
- **1 is Lapsed** (Barker $470K)

The five cooling donors represent **$3.3M in lifetime giving** and haven't given in 200-323 days. Cheryl Lampe alone, the #1 donor at $1.6M lifetime, is cooling with 200 days since last gift. This requires immediate personal intervention.

**Insight #4: 128 Households Fund 74% of All Giving**
Of 55,625 households, only 128 ($10K+ giving) account for **$10.2M — 74% of total giving**. Meanwhile, 50,633 households (91%) have given $0. This extreme concentration means the organization's financial health depends on relationships with roughly 100 families.

**Insight #5: December Dependence Is a Structural Vulnerability**
December generates **25% of annual giving** ($1.67M lifetime, $492K in Dec 2024 alone). November-December combined = 34%. A failed year-end campaign would be catastrophic. The organization needs to build mid-year giving peaks through events, campaigns, and recurring giving.

**Insight #6: New Donor Acquisition Has Stalled**
The donor base peaked at 2,293 unique donors in 2022, driven by an influx of new donors (likely from Givebutter/digital campaigns). By 2024, only 1,723 unique donors remained. New donor acquisition declined from a high of ~1,300/year (2022) to significantly fewer. The pipeline needs rebuilding.

**Insight #7: The $205K/Year Recurring Revenue Hole**
383 recurring donors were lost in the Kindful→Givebutter platform migration. These donors had active recurring gifts totaling $17,127/month ($205,518/year). Of these, 317 still have "active" status but their payment tokens were lost — they want to give but the system can't process their gifts. This is recoverable revenue, not lost donors.

### COMMERCE & SUBSCRIPTIONS

**Insight #8: 29,220 Buyers Have Never Donated — $2.4M in Non-Donor Commerce**
87% of product buyers (29,220 of 33,694) have **never made a donation**. They've spent $2.4M on True Girl products, books, tour tickets, and resources. These people already trust the brand, already have payment methods on file, and have demonstrated willingness to spend. They are the warmest possible audience for a first-gift ask. Yet they've never been asked.

**Insight #9: Commerce Average Order Value Is Declining**
Average order value has dropped from $37 (2021) to $15 (2025). Total order volume is increasing (18K → 63K orders), suggesting more frequent, smaller purchases — likely digital content and small resources rather than physical products. This is a pricing or product mix shift that needs investigation.

**Insight #10: The Subscription Box Has Functionally Failed**
Only **41 of 6,337 subscriptions remain active** (0.6% retention). The $30/month Physical Monthly box (1 Girl) — the core product — has 13 active subscribers out of 4,672 total. The digital subscription retained slightly better at 7.2%. The platform migration destroyed billing continuity for nearly all subscribers. This was a ~$475K/year revenue stream that has been reduced to ~$14K/year.

**Insight #11: Subscriber-Donors Are Extremely Valuable**
The 1,038 people who were both subscribers AND donors (now inactive on subscriptions) have an average lifetime giving of **$3,641** — 3x the overall donor average. These people were deeply invested in the ministry through both giving and product engagement. They are the ideal audience for a subscription relaunch paired with renewed giving.

**Insight #12: 2,742 VIP Buyers Are Invisible to the Fundraising Team**
Buyers with 20+ orders (2,742 people, $608 avg spend, 41 avg orders) represent the most loyal product customers. Many have been purchasing for years. Yet they sit in commerce data completely disconnected from any development outreach. A simple "You've been a True Girl customer for 3 years — did you know we're a nonprofit?" campaign could convert hundreds.

### ENGAGEMENT & PROGRAMS

**Insight #13: 61% of Contacts Have Never Transacted**
51,925 people (61%) have tag engagement (email opens, event signups, content downloads) but have never purchased a product or made a donation. They are digitally engaged but have never crossed the transaction threshold. The gap between engagement and transaction represents a fundamental funnel problem.

**Insight #14: The Engagement-to-Donor Cliff**
People with 100+ tags have a **66.5% donor rate** and average $5,424 in giving. But people with 30-100 tags — still highly engaged — have only a **7.6% donor rate** and $26 avg giving. There is no gradual progression; there is a cliff. The organization lacks a mid-funnel conversion mechanism that turns engaged followers into first-time givers.

**Insight #15: True Girl Is the Dominant Audience — and It's Underleveraged**
64,569 people are tagged with True Girl engagement. The TG Power Pack email list alone has 31,297 contacts. But only **186 people** have a "True Girl Donation" tag. The True Girl audience is being treated as a product/content audience, not a donor cultivation audience. The path from "True Girl mom" to "Freedom Partner donor" has never been built.

**Insight #16: Bible Study Reach Is Growing But Monetization Is Missing**
B2BB (Born to Be Brave) reaches 9,752 people. Tour marketing for B2BB (Fall '24, '25) shows continued investment in this line. Nurture campaigns for Bible studies reach 18,000-37,000 people each (Master Class, BFF Workshop, Miriam study). Yet there is no data showing Bible study → donor conversion funnels. These large, engaged audiences have no giving pathway.

**Insight #17: Tours Are the #1 Acquisition Engine**
Tour marketing campaigns reach 10,000-18,000 people per season across Pajama Party, Crazy Hair, and B2BB tours. The Spring 2025 CHT (Crazy Hair Tour) alone reached 24,872 contacts for marketing and 4,016 for purchases. Tours generate the largest single-event engagement spikes in the database. They should be treated not just as revenue events but as the top of the donor acquisition funnel.

**Insight #18: Communication Volume Is Shockingly Low**
Only **24,040 communication records** exist across 84,507 contacts. The average active donor receives 30 communications; prospects receive 0. For a database of this size, communication volume should be 10-50x higher. The organization either isn't logging communications properly or isn't communicating with the vast majority of its audience beyond email blasts (which aren't tracked here).

### WEALTH & MAJOR GIFTS

**Insight #19: $50M+ in Untapped Wealth Capacity**
1,109 contacts have been wealth-screened. The results reveal:
- **29 Ultra High** ($250K+ capacity): Avg capacity $817,852, avg actual giving $20,331 — **$797K avg gap**
- **114 Very High** ($100K-$250K): $144K capacity, $15K actual — **$129K avg gap**
- **391 High** ($25K-$100K): $44K capacity, $3.2K actual — **$41K avg gap**

Total untapped capacity across all tiers exceeds $50M. Even capturing 2% incremental would yield $1M+ in new giving.

**Insight #20: The Major Gift Program Doesn't Exist**
Despite having 29 Ultra High capacity prospects and 114 Very High prospects, there is no evidence of systematic major gift cultivation in the data. Communication records for these individuals are minimal. There are no "major gift officer" tags, no cultivation stage tracking, no proposal records. The wealth screening data was collected but never operationalized.

### DATA & INFRASTRUCTURE

**Insight #21: 3,474 Stripe Customers Are Unlinked — $1.27M in Anonymous Revenue**
The Stripe payment platform processed $2.0M through 6,766 customers, but 3,474 (51%) cannot be matched to any identity in the database. These unlinked customers actually spend MORE ($364 avg vs. $219 for linked). They represent paying constituents who are completely invisible to the CRM.

**Insight #22: State Data Duplication Affects Geographic Targeting**
Address data contains both abbreviations and full names (TX + Texas, FL + Florida, PA + Pennsylvania). This creates inaccurate geographic reports and prevents effective regional campaign targeting. A simple normalization would fix this.

**Insight #23: 40% of the Database Has No Physical Address**
While email coverage is excellent (96.6%), only 56% of contacts have a city and 53% have a phone number. For major donor cultivation and event marketing, physical contact information is essential. Append services could fill this gap for high-value segments.

**Insight #24: The Tag System Is Powerful But Chaotic**
2,973,999 tag assignments across 41 tag groups represent an extraordinarily rich engagement dataset. However, 1.8M assignments (61%) have NULL tag_group, meaning they can't be categorized by program. Many tag names are campaign-specific ("Sept10", "Keep2024", "greatgirl2024open") rather than behavioral. A tag taxonomy cleanup would dramatically improve segmentation capability.

**Insight #25: Recent Giving Is Falling Off a Cliff**
Monthly giving in the last three months of available data:
- Aug 2025: $21,875
- Sep 2025: $15,711
- Oct 2025: $10,288

Compare to the same period in 2024: Aug $63K, Sep $51K, Oct $110K. This is a **75-90% decline** in monthly giving. If this trend is real (and not a data lag), it represents an immediate financial emergency that needs investigation.

## 5. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strategy 1: Donor Retention Emergency Program
**Objective:** Raise retention from 33% to 50% within 18 months

**Actions:**
- Implement automated new-donor welcome series (Day 0, 7, 30, 90)
- Create "Cooling Champions" alert system for donors approaching 180 days since last gift
- Assign top 100 cooling/lapsing committed donors to personal stewardship
- Monthly impact reports to all donors (not asks — stewardship)
- Post-gift thank you within 48 hours (currently no evidence of systematic thank-yous)

**Expected Impact:** +850 retained donors/year, +$500K-$800K in preserved giving

### Strategy 2: Commerce-to-Donor Conversion Engine
**Objective:** Convert 2,000 of 29,220 non-donor buyers to first-time givers

**Actions:**
- Add "Did you know we're a nonprofit?" messaging to post-purchase emails
- Create "True Girl Freedom Partner" $15/month ask in product packaging
- Target VIP buyers (2,742) with personalized "Your True Girl Story" ask
- A/B test: product receipt with giving ask vs. separate cultivation email
- Track buyer → donor conversion rate as a core KPI

**Expected Impact:** 2,000 new donors × $44 avg first gift = $88K year 1, growing to $300K+ with retention

### Strategy 3: Subscription Box 2.0 Relaunch
**Objective:** Rebuild to 1,500 active subscribers within 12 months

**Actions:**
- New platform with reliable billing (not dependent on Keap)
- Tiered pricing: $12/month digital, $25/month physical, $39/month physical + monthly giving
- "Founding Member" campaign to 6,337 former subscribers
- Post-tour upsell (8,381 people already received post-tour box sale tags)
- Target TG Power Pack list (31,297) as primary acquisition audience

**Expected Impact:** 1,500 subs × $25 avg × 12 months = $450K/year + donor acquisition through bundled giving tier

### Strategy 4: Major Gift Program Launch
**Objective:** Secure $500K in new major gifts within 24 months

**Actions:**
- Assign or hire a Major Gift Officer (even part-time)
- Create cultivation pipeline for 29 Ultra High + 114 Very High prospects
- Personal visits to top 20 capacity-gap individuals
- Ministry tour/behind-the-scenes experience for top prospects
- Quarterly progress tracking with move management system

**Expected Impact:** 5 gifts at $50K+ avg = $250K year 1, building to $500K+ year 2

### Strategy 5: Mid-Level Donor Development
**Objective:** Grow the $1K-$10K tier from 678 to 1,000 donors

**Actions:**
- Create "Ministry Circle" giving society ($1K+/year)
- Exclusive content, early tour access, annual appreciation event
- Targeted upgrade asks to $500-$999 donors showing engagement
- Monthly giving ladder: encourage $84/month ($1K/year threshold)

**Expected Impact:** 322 new mid-level donors × $2,500 avg = $805K in new annual giving

### Strategy 6: Tour-to-Donor Funnel
**Objective:** Convert 5% of tour attendees to donors (currently ~0%)

**Actions:**
- Pre-tour: "Meet the ministry" content series to marketing list (24,872+)
- At-event: donation opportunity (text-to-give, QR code) with matching gift
- Post-tour Day 3: Thank you + "Your daughter's experience was made possible by donors"
- Post-tour Day 14: First gift ask with specific program impact
- Post-tour Day 30: "Freedom Partner" recurring ask

**Expected Impact:** 5% of 10,000 tour attendees = 500 new donors/season

### Strategy 7: Bible Study Giving Integration
**Objective:** Build giving pathways into all Bible study experiences

**Actions:**
- Add "scholarship gift" option to study registration: "Add $15 to sponsor another family"
- End-of-study "go deeper" message with giving opportunity
- Create B2BB-specific giving fund: "Put Bibles in Brave Girls' Hands"
- Cross-promote between Bible study participants and subscription box

**Expected Impact:** 500 study-driven gifts/year × $50 avg = $25K initial, growing with study launches

### Strategy 8: Data Quality & Infrastructure
**Objective:** Clean data foundations to enable all other strategies

**Actions:**
- Normalize state data (TX/Texas, FL/Florida, etc.)
- Match 3,474 unlinked Stripe customers by email
- Classify 1.8M NULL tag_group assignments into program categories
- Append phone numbers for top 5,000 contacts (donors + VIP buyers)
- Implement communication logging across all channels
- Build automated "data health" dashboard

**Expected Impact:** Enables accurate segmentation, geographic targeting, and multi-channel outreach

## CLOSING ASSESSMENT

Pure Freedom Ministries has built an extraordinary audience of **84,507 engaged people** who care about the mission of discipling tween girls and equipping moms. The True Girl brand has remarkable reach — 64,569 people engaged, tours drawing 10,000-18,000 per season, Bible studies reaching 20,000-37,000 per campaign.

**The core problem is not reach. It's conversion.**

Only 6% of contacts have ever donated. Only 0.4% are active donors. The organization has mastered audience building through content, tours, and digital marketing — but has not built the bridge from "engaged follower" to "financial partner."

The three highest-leverage actions are:
1. **Stop the bleeding** — Personal intervention with the 5 cooling top-10 donors ($3.3M at risk) and systematic retention overhaul
2. **Build the bridge** — Commerce-to-donor conversion engine targeting 29,220 non-donor buyers
3. **Go deeper** — Major gift program leveraging $50M+ in untapped wealth capacity

If these three strategies are executed well, the ministry can realistically grow from **$1.4M/year in giving** (2024) to **$2.5M-$3M/year within 24 months** — while reducing concentration risk and building a more sustainable financial foundation.

The data is here. The audience is here. The capacity is here. What's needed is the strategic bridge between engagement and generosity.

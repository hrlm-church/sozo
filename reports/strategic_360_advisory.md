```

**The core insight**: 94% of the ministry's audience has never made a donation. But 40% have purchased products. The gap between engagement and generosity is the single largest strategic opportunity.

## 2. THE FIVE STREAMS

### Stream 1: Donations — $7.1M Lifetime

**The story**: Giving is growing in dollars but shrinking in donors. The ministry is earning more from fewer people, creating dangerous concentration.

| Year | Donors | Gifts | Total | Avg Gift | Retention |
|------|--------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 2020 | 1,219 | 9,949 | $621K | $62 | 74.1% |
| 2021 | 1,237 | 9,279 | $730K | $78 | 71.6% |
| 2022 | 2,293 | 9,468 | $837K | $88 | 37.4% |
| 2023 | 2,158 | 7,939 | $1.06M | $133 | 34.3% |
| 2024 | 1,723 | 7,318 | $1.41M | $193 | 33.3% |
| 2025* | 888 | 5,235 | $799K | $152 | — |

*2025 partial (through ~Oct)

**Donor Pyramid:**

| Tier | Donors | Total Given | % of Giving | Avg Frequency |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| $50K+ | 21 | $3.25M | 50% | 64 gifts |
| $10K-$50K | 55 | $1.12M | 17% | 69 gifts |
| $5K-$10K | 49 | $344K | 5% | 70 gifts |
| $1K-$5K | 629 | $1.46M | 22% | 69 gifts |
| Under $1K | 4,276 | $330K | 5% | 2 gifts |

**Top 10 Donors (corrected, deduplicated):**

| Donor | Lifetime | Gifts | Commerce | Tags | Status | Days Since |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|------|--------|------------|
| Cheryl Lampe | $794,569 | 40 | $305,214 | 185 | Cooling | 200 |
| Matt Fletcher | $383,235 | 61 | $175,015 | 234 | Cooling | 323 |
| Alia Whitman | $287,398 | 327 | $293 | 195 | Active | 152 |
| Scott Stober | $225,729 | 17 | $3,250 | 149 | Cooling | 216 |
| Kay Barker | $202,559 | 25 | $12,000 | 165 | Lapsed | 422 |
| Renay Cohen | $122,988 | 97 | $12,000 | 182 | Cooling | 262 |
| Cynthia Johnson | $122,200 | 26 | $44,152 | 263 | Active | 122 |
| Martin Jones | $121,750 | 9 | $115,000 | 143 | Cooling | 270 |
| Ann Nicholson | $102,431 | 135 | $74,034 | 183 | Active | 166 |
| Linda Laskin | $98,565 | 127 | $27,639 | 170 | Active | 178 |

**Critical observation**: 5 of the top 10 donors are also significant commerce buyers. These are not just donors — they are multi-stream partners. Lampe ($305K commerce), Fletcher ($175K), Jones ($115K), Nicholson ($74K), and Johnson ($44K) are deeply invested across both giving and buying.

**Lifecycle Distribution:**

| Stage | People | Giving | Avg Giving |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| Active (≤180 days) | 369 | $2.25M | $6,096 |
| Cooling (181-365 days) | 420 | $2.27M | $5,399 |
| Lapsed (1-2 years) | 1,093 | $1.21M | $1,111 |
| Lost (2+ years) | 3,155 | $829K | $262 |
| Prospect (never gave) | 79,458 | — | — |

**Payment Channels:**

| Method | Total | Payers | Avg per Payer |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Credit Card | $5.92M | 31,617 | $187 |
| Check | $1.46M | 118 | **$12,384** |
| POS/In-Person | $97K | 2,989 | $32 |
| Refunds | -$135K | 1,441 | — |

Check writers average **$12,384 per person** — 66x the credit card average. These 118 people are your major gift core.

**Source System Breakdown:**

| Source | Gifts | Total | Share |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Donor Direct | 64,115 | $6.47M | 91% |
| Givebutter | 1,743 | $614K | 9% |
| Keap Import | 442 | $17K | <1% |
| Kindful | 260 | $14K | <1% |

Givebutter surged from $23K (2022) to $205K (2024) — digital giving is growing fast.

---

### Stream 2: Commerce — $4.7M Lifetime, 205K Orders

**The story**: Commerce is the ministry's largest reach channel — 33,694 unique buyers, 4x the donor base. Volume is exploding but AOV is collapsing, suggesting a product mix shift from physical goods to lower-priced digital content.

| Year | Buyers | Orders | Revenue | Avg Order |
|------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 2020 | 3,889 | 6,013 | * | * |
| 2021 | 5,108 | 18,434 | $696K | $37 |
| 2022 | 11,778 | 35,855 | $1.37M | $38 |
| 2023 | 8,256 | 48,956 | $1.0M | $20 |
| 2024 | 12,156 | 63,397 | $1.13M | $17 |
| 2025* | 6,846 | 32,527 | $499K | $15 |

*2020 had no revenue data in Keap; 2025 is partial year

**Buyer Segments:**

| Segment | People | Avg Spent | Total Revenue |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Single order (1) | 19,594 | $61 | $1.20M |
| Repeat (2-5) | 7,003 | $110 | $771K |
| Loyal (6-20) | 4,408 | $241 | $1.06M |
| VIP (21-50) | 2,185 | $501 | $1.09M |
| Power (51+) | 78 | $3,285 | $256K |

**Top 15 Buyers:**

| Buyer | Orders | Total Spent | Avg Order | First | Last |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------|
| Cheryl Lampe | 11 | $305,214 | $27,746 | 2021-03 | 2025-06 |
| Matt Fletcher | 4 | $300,015 | $75,003 | 2022-07 | 2024-10 |
| Martin Jones | 6 | $115,000 | $19,166 | 2022-09 | 2024-10 |
| Ann Nicholson | 7 | $74,034 | $10,576 | 2023-04 | 2025-06 |
| Cynthia Johnson | 63 | $44,152 | $701 | 2021-04 | 2025-06 |
| Freya Spence | 1,501 | $39,963 | $27 | 2021-02 | 2025-07 |
| Tiffany Taylor | 1,339 | $34,936 | $26 | 2022-05 | 2025-10 |

**Key observation**: The top commerce buyers overlap significantly with top donors. Lampe, Fletcher, Jones, Nicholson, and Johnson appear in both top donor and top buyer lists. They are **multi-stream partners** whose total ministry investment (giving + commerce) exceeds what either stream shows alone. Lampe alone: $795K giving + $305K commerce = **$1.1M total ministry investment**.

Meanwhile, high-frequency buyers like Freya Spence (1,501 orders) and Tiffany Taylor (1,339 orders) are clearly automated subscription-style purchasers — likely representing True Girl box or recurring content deliveries processed as orders. This explains the AOV decline: more frequent, smaller orders for subscription-like products.

---

### Stream 3: Subscriptions — Collapsed from $475K/yr to $14K/yr

**The story**: The True Girl subscription box was a growing $475K/year revenue stream that collapsed during the Kindful→Givebutter platform migration. Billing tokens were lost. Only 41 of 6,337 subscriptions remain active.

**Product Breakdown:**

| Product | Total | Active | Inactive | Monthly Value |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Physical Monthly: 1 Girl ($30) | 4,672 | 13 | 4,659 | $390 |
| Freedom Partner Monthly Giving | 79 | 6 | 73 | $187 |
| Physical Monthly: 2+ Girls | 365 | 5 | 360 | $175 |
| Digital Monthly ($10-20) | 483 | 11 | 472 | $159 |
| Physical Quarterly | 109 | 0 | 109 | $0 |
| Other products | 629 | 6 | 623 | $285 |
| **Total** | **6,337** | **41** | **6,296** | **$1,196/mo** |

**Subscriber Cross-Stream Behavior:**

| Segment | People | Avg Giving | Avg Commerce |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Buys but doesn't donate | 4,987 | $0 | $277 |
| Buys AND donates | 1,249 | **$3,593** | **$1,723** |
| Neither buys nor donates | 87 | $0 | $0 |
| Donates but doesn't buy | 14 | $3,685 | $0 |

The 1,249 subscriber-donors are the **highest-value cohort in the entire database**: $3,593 avg giving + $1,723 avg commerce = **$5,316 total ministry investment** per person. They are 3x more valuable than the average donor and 20x more valuable than the average buyer.

The 4,987 subscribers who buy but never donated represent the warmest conversion opportunity after the 27,533 buyer-only segment.

---

### Stream 4: Tours & Events — The Acquisition Engine

**The story**: Tours are the ministry's most powerful audience builder. Tour-related tags reach tens of thousands of contacts per season, yet there is no systematic path from tour attendance to giving or sustained engagement.

**Tour Reach (from tag data):**

| Tour/Event | Tag Assignments | Registered |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Crazy Hair Tour (CHT) - All audience marketing | 24,872 | ~4,946 (Spr '24) |
| Crazy Hair Tour Spring 2025 | Marketing in progress | 3,870 registered |
| Pajama Party Tour (PPT) Spring 2023 | — | 3,830 registered |
| B2BB Tour Fall 2024 | 7,435 marketing | 801 purchased |
| B2BB Tour Fall 2025 | Marketing in progress | 485 purchased |
| Post-event special offers (CHT) | 6,770 | — |
| True Girl Live events | 516+ | — |
| Pop-Up Parties | Various | — |

**Key venue data (B2BB):**
Top performing venues by registration: Manheim PA (1,688), Allen TX (1,286), Crystal River FL (1,037), Mansfield OH (975)

**What's missing**: There is no "tour attendee → first gift" funnel in the data. Tour tags show registration and marketing, but no donation-related follow-up. The largest audience acquisition channel feeds directly into the "engaged but never transacted" bucket (51,925 people).

---

### Stream 5: Bible Studies & Content — Deep Engagement, Zero Monetization

**The story**: Content programs create the deepest engagement in the database. People who engage with 100+ tags are 18x more likely to donate. Yet Bible studies and content programs have no built-in giving pathway.

**Program Reach:**

| Program/Content | People |
|-----------------|--------|
| True Girl (all content) | 64,569 |
| TG Power Pack email list | 31,297 |
| Fix Your Funnel (automation) | 59,290 |
| Nurture campaigns | 45,541 |
| True Productions | 49,596 |
| Memberships | 33,172 |
| Customer engagement | 32,592 |
| Lies Moms Believe | 28,088 |
| Donor assignments | 17,939 |
| Born to Be Brave (B2BB) | 9,752 |

**Top Nurture/Content Campaigns (from tag data):**
- Master Class: ~37K
- BFF Workshop: ~33K
- Living Happily Even After: ~25K
- Miriam: ~15K
- Guilt-Free Mom: ~10K

**Engagement Depth → Conversion (The Cliff):**

| Tag Count | People | Donor Rate | Buyer Rate | Avg Giving | Avg Commerce |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| 0 tags | 3,170 | 3.7% | 0% | $19 | $0 |
| 1-5 | 3,684 | 0.2% | 27.3% | $0 | $13 |
| 6-15 | 18,291 | 0.5% | 26.6% | $0 | $18 |
| 16-30 | 17,269 | 1.6% | 47.2% | $1 | $29 |
| 31-100 | 39,890 | 7.7% | 40.4% | $14 | $42 |
| **100+** | **2,191** | **67.6%** | **83.8%** | **$2,686** | **$997** |

This is the most important table in this report. There is a **conversion cliff** between 31-100 tags (7.7% donor rate) and 100+ tags (67.6%). The ministry has 39,890 people in the 31-100 bracket who are deeply engaged but haven't crossed the giving threshold. That's because no mechanism exists to move them there.

Commerce has a smoother progression: 27% buyer rate at 1-5 tags, growing to 84% at 100+. Products are offered throughout the engagement journey. Donations are not.

---

## 3. CROSS-STREAM INTELLIGENCE

### The Multi-Stream Value Multiplier

People who engage with multiple streams are exponentially more valuable:

| Engagement Level | People | Avg Giving | Avg Commerce | Avg Tags |
|-----------------|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Donor + Buyer | 4,428 | $1,230 | $537 | 82 |
| Subscriber + Buyer + Donor | 1,249 | $3,593 | $1,723 | 100+ |
| Donor Only | 609 | $1,828 | $0 | 87 |
| Buyer Only | 27,533 | $0 | $87 | 39 |
| Engaged Only | 51,925 | $0 | $0 | 28 |

**The math**: If even 5% of the 27,533 buyer-only segment converts to donor at the average first-gift of $62, that's 1,377 new donors × $62 = **$85K immediate, growing to $300K+ with retention**.

If 1% of the 51,925 engaged-only segment makes a first purchase, that's 519 new buyers × $61 avg first order = **$32K in new commerce**.

### Household Intelligence

| Household Size | Count | % of All | Total Giving | Avg Giving |
|----------------|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 person | 52,651 | 94.7% | $5.14M | $97 |
| 2 people (couples) | 1,898 | 3.4% | $1.31M | **$688** |
| 3-5 people | 787 | 1.4% | $64K | $80 |
| 6+ people | 288 | 0.5% | $50K | $174 |

Two-person households (couples) give **7x more** than singles ($688 vs $97). They are 3.4% of households but contribute 20% of giving. The ministry should identify and cultivate couples specifically.

**Top 10 Giving Households:**

| Household | Members | Total Giving | Trend | State |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Lampe | 2 | $795K | Stable | Florida |
| Fletcher | 1 | $383K | Stable | Virginia |
| Whitman | 1 | $287K | Stable | Ohio |
| Stober | 1 | $226K | Stable | Nebraska |
| Barker | 2 | $214K | Declining | Pennsylvania |
| Cohen | 1 | $123K | Stable | Texas |
| Johnson | 1 | $122K | Stable | Oregon |
| Jones | 1 | $122K | Stable | Michigan |
| Nicholson | 1 | $102K | Stable | Florida |
| Laskin | 1 | $99K | Stable | Florida |

### Geographic Concentration

| State | Contacts | Donors | Buyers | Total Giving |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Texas | 5,116* | 522 | 3,241 | $520K |
| Florida | 3,087 | 284 | 2,520 | $1.18M |
| Ohio | 2,979 | 286 | 2,684 | $347K |
| Pennsylvania | 2,509 | 361 | 2,195 | $883K |
| Michigan | 1,986 | 218 | 1,755 | $97K |
| North Carolina | 1,707 | 181 | 1,450 | $65K |
| Georgia | 1,694 | 204 | 1,414 | $122K |
| Tennessee | 1,654 | 137 | 1,480 | $49K |
| California | 1,643 | 215 | 1,002 | $286K |
| Virginia | 1,100 | 103 | 884 | $433K |

*Texas contacts split across "Texas" and "TX" — state normalization needed

**Per-capita giving leaders**: Virginia ($433K from 1,100 contacts = $394/contact), Florida ($1.18M/3,087 = $383/contact), Pennsylvania ($883K/2,509 = $352/contact). These are the strongest giving markets for event targeting.

### Wealth Screening — $58M Untapped

| Tier | People | Avg Capacity | Avg Given | Gap | Total Capacity | Total Given |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|-----|---------------|-------------|
| Ultra High ($250K+) | 29 | $817,852 | $20,331 | $797K | $23.7M | $590K |
| Very High ($100K-$250K) | 114 | $144,324 | $15,579 | $129K | $16.5M | $1.78M |
| High ($25K-$100K) | 391 | $43,930 | $3,201 | $41K | $17.2M | $1.25M |
| Medium ($10K-$25K) | 178 | $18,391 | $1,152 | $17K | $3.3M | $205K |
| Standard | 397 | $5,076 | $1,510 | $4K | $2.0M | $600K |
| **Total** | **1,109** | | | | **$62.6M** | **$4.4M** |

**Top Wealth Prospects by Gap:**

| Name | Capacity | Given | Gap | Gifts | Status |
|------|----------|-------|-----|-------|--------|
| Kathy Westbury | $1.78M | $620 | $1.78M | 5 | Lapsed |
| Rachel Buller | $1.75M | $1,520 | $1.75M | 3 | Lapsed |
| Erika Wood | $1.65M | $10,780 | $1.64M | 107 | Cooling |
| Matt Hayden | $1.30M | $0 | $1.30M | 0 | Non-donor |
| Julie Hayden | $1.30M | $500 | $1.30M | 7 | Lapsed |
| Angie Lampert | $1.23M | $100 | $1.23M | 3 | Lost |
| Rachelle Bergey | $1.13M | $80,300 | $1.05M | 16 | Lapsed |
| Linda Laskin | $1.10M | $98,565 | $1.00M | 127 | Active |

Most high-capacity prospects are **lapsed or lost** — they once engaged but the relationship was not cultivated. Erika Wood gave 107 times but is now cooling. Rachelle Bergey gave $80K but lapsed. These are winnable conversations.

### Stripe — The Invisible Revenue

| Status | Customers | Total Spend | Avg Spend | Payments |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Linked to identity | 3,292 | $721K | $219 | — |
| **Unlinked** | **3,474** | **$1.27M** | **$364** | — |

3,474 Stripe customers cannot be matched to anyone in the database. They spend **66% more** than linked customers. These are paying constituents who are invisible to the CRM — no thank-yous, no asks, no relationship.

### Lost Recurring Donors — $205K/Year Hole

| Category | Donors | Annual Lost | Migrating to Givebutter? |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Active (expected migration) | 257 | $145K | Yes |
| Active (not migrating) | 60 | $28K | No |
| Cancelled | 66 | $33K | No |

The 257 migrating to Givebutter should reconnect automatically. The 126 NOT migrating represent **$61K/year in true lost revenue** that requires personal outreach.

### Communications — Dangerously Low Volume

| Channel | Records | People | Direction |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Email | 16,407 | ~3,400 | Mixed |
| Phone | 1,680 | ~950 | Mixed |
| Notes | 1,132 | 548 | Internal |
| Meetings | 462 | 419 | — |
| Thank-you notes | 428 | ~300 | Outbound |
| SMS/Text | 394 | ~260 | Mixed |
| Letters | 282 | 185 | Outbound |

**24,040 total communications across 84,507 contacts** — a ratio of 0.28 communications per contact. For a healthy nonprofit CRM, this should be 10-50x higher. Either communications aren't being logged, or the vast majority of the audience receives no personalized outreach beyond mass email (which isn't tracked here).

## 4. 25 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### GIVING

**Insight #1: Donor Retention Has Collapsed**
Year-over-year retention dropped from **74.1% (2020) to 33.3% (2024)**. Industry average is 40-45%. Two-thirds of donors who give in any year do not give the following year. The collapse began in 2022 — coinciding with the Kindful platform migration.

**Insight #2: Revenue Growing on a Narrowing Foundation**
Annual giving grew from $621K (2020) to $1.41M (2024) — 127% increase. But average gift tripled ($62→$193) while donor count barely moved. The organization is building a taller building on a narrower base.

**Insight #3: 5 of the Top 10 Donors Are Cooling**
Lampe ($795K), Fletcher ($383K), Stober ($226K), Cohen ($123K), and Jones ($122K) — totaling **$1.65M in lifetime giving** — haven't given in 200-323 days. Barker ($203K) is already lapsed at 422 days. These six individuals require immediate personal contact.

**Insight #4: 78 Households = 68% of All Giving**
Of 55,625 households, only 78 ($10K+ giving) account for **$4.59M — 68% of total giving**. 50,633 households (91%) have given $0. The ministry's financial health depends on fewer than 80 families.

**Insight #5: Check Writers Are the Hidden Major Donor Pool**
118 check writers average **$12,384 each** — 66x the credit card average of $187. Check writing signals major-gift capacity and intentional, planned giving. These 118 people should be treated as the major gift prospect pool.

### COMMERCE

**Insight #6: 27,533 Buyers Have Never Donated**
87% of product buyers have **never made a donation**. They've spent collectively on True Girl products, books, tour tickets, and resources. They already trust the brand. They are the warmest possible audience for a first-gift ask.

**Insight #7: Average Order Value Has Collapsed — But That's Not All Bad**
AOV dropped from $38 (2022) to $15 (2025). But order volume grew from 36K to 63K. The shift reflects more frequent, lower-priced purchases — likely digital content, subscription-style deliveries, and small resources. The ministry is reaching more people more often, but at lower price points. The opportunity: pair low-cost digital products with giving asks.

**Insight #8: High-Frequency Buyers Are Subscription-Like**
78 power buyers (51+ orders) average $3,285 in spend. Buyers like Freya Spence (1,501 orders, $27 avg) and Tiffany Taylor (1,339 orders, $26 avg) are clearly receiving automated/recurring deliveries. This cohort represents the functional continuation of the subscription model even though "subscriptions" show as collapsed.

**Insight #9: Top Buyers Are Also Top Donors — They're Multi-Stream Partners**
5 of the top 10 donors also appear in the top commerce buyers. Cheryl Lampe's total ministry investment is $1.1M ($795K giving + $305K commerce). These people should be stewarded as multi-stream partners, not managed separately by fundraising and product teams.

### SUBSCRIPTIONS

**Insight #10: The Subscription Box Collapsed — But the Audience Didn't Leave**
Only 41 of 6,337 subscriptions remain active (0.6%). But 4,987 former subscribers are still buying products, and 1,249 former subscribers are still donating. The audience didn't leave the ministry — they lost their billing continuity.

**Insight #11: Subscriber-Donors Are the Most Valuable Cohort**
The 1,249 people who subscribed AND donated average **$3,593 in giving + $1,723 in commerce = $5,316 total**. This is 3x the average donor and 60x the average buyer. Multi-stream engagement is the strongest predictor of lifetime value.

### ENGAGEMENT & CONTENT

**Insight #12: The Engagement-to-Giving Cliff Is the Biggest Structural Problem**
People with 100+ tags: 67.6% donor rate, $2,686 avg giving. People with 31-100 tags: 7.7% donor rate, $14 avg giving. There is no gradual progression — there is a cliff. **39,890 people** sit at the 31-100 tag level with no mechanism to bridge them to giving.

Commerce has a smoother curve (27% buyer rate at 1-5 tags, 47% at 16-30, 84% at 100+). Products are offered throughout the journey. Donations are not.

**Insight #13: True Girl Is 76% of the Audience — And It's Underleveraged for Giving**
64,569 contacts are tagged with True Girl engagement. The TG Power Pack email list alone has 31,297 contacts. But only 186 people have a "True Girl Donation" tag. The True Girl audience is treated as a product/content audience, not a donor cultivation audience.

**Insight #14: Bible Studies Create Deep Engagement But No Giving Pathway**
B2BB reaches 9,752 people. Tour marketing for B2BB shows continued investment. Nurture campaigns reach 18K-37K per study (Master Class, BFF Workshop, Miriam). There is no data showing Bible study → donor conversion. These large, engaged audiences have no giving pathway.

**Insight #15: Tours Are the #1 Acquisition Engine — Without a Conversion Funnel**
Tour marketing reaches 24,872+ contacts per season (CHT alone). 4,946 registered for CHT Spring 2024. 3,870 for CHT Spring 2025. These are the largest single-event audience spikes in the database. But there is no "tour attendee → first gift" follow-up in the data. Tours feed engagement, not revenue.

### WEALTH & INFRASTRUCTURE

**Insight #16: $58M in Untapped Wealth Capacity**
1,109 wealth-screened contacts show $62.6M in total capacity vs $4.4M actually given. The 29 Ultra High contacts alone have $23.7M in capacity but have given only $590K. Even capturing 2% incremental would yield $1M+.

**Insight #17: The Major Gift Program Doesn't Exist**
Despite 29 Ultra High and 114 Very High capacity prospects, there is no systematic major gift cultivation. Communication records for these individuals are minimal. The wealth screening data was collected but never operationalized. Most high-capacity prospects are **lapsed or lost**.

**Insight #18: 3,474 Stripe Customers Are Invisible**
51% of Stripe customers cannot be matched to any identity. They spend 66% MORE than linked customers ($364 vs $219 avg). These are paying constituents with zero CRM relationship.

**Insight #19: Communication Volume Is 50x Too Low**
24,040 records across 84,507 contacts = 0.28 communications per person. Active donors average ~30 touchpoints; prospects get 0. For this database size, volume should be 500K-1M+ records if all channels are logged.

**Insight #20: State Data Needs Normalization**
"Texas" and "TX" appear as separate states, same for FL/Florida, PA/Pennsylvania. This prevents accurate geographic targeting.

**Insight #21: 61% of Tags Have No Group Classification**
1.8M of 2.97M tag assignments (61%) have NULL tag_group. Many tag names are campaign-specific ("Sept10", "Keep2024") rather than behavioral. A tag taxonomy cleanup would dramatically improve segmentation.

### EMERGING PATTERNS

**Insight #22: Digital Giving Is Accelerating**
Givebutter went from $23K (2022) to $205K (2024). Digital giving now represents 15% of annual revenue, up from 3%. The ministry needs to invest in digital giving infrastructure as a primary channel, not a secondary one.

**Insight #23: 2025 Q3-Q4 Giving Shows Alarming Decline**
Monthly giving in recent months: Aug $21.9K, Sep $15.7K, Oct $10.3K. Compare to 2024: Aug $63K, Sep $51K, Oct $110K. This is a **75-90% decline**. If this is real (not data lag), it's an immediate financial emergency.

**Insight #24: Couples Give 7x More Than Singles**
Two-person households average $688 in giving vs $97 for singles. They are 3.4% of households but 20% of giving. Targeting couples specifically (through "Mom & Dad" messaging, couple events, family subscriptions) could significantly increase per-household value.

**Insight #25: The $205K Recurring Revenue Hole Is Partially Self-Healing**
Of 383 lost recurring donors, 257 ($145K/year) are expected to migrate to Givebutter. The remaining 126 ($61K/year) are truly lost. Personal outreach to these 126 people is the fastest revenue recovery action available.

## 6. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strategy 1: Donor Retention Emergency Program
**Objective:** Raise retention from 33% to 50% within 18 months

**Actions:**
- Automated new-donor welcome series (Day 0, 7, 30, 90)
- "Cooling Champions" alert for donors approaching 180 days since last gift
- Top 100 cooling/lapsing committed donors assigned to personal stewardship
- Monthly impact reports (stewardship, not asks)
- Post-gift thank-you within 48 hours
- Personal calls to 5 cooling top-10 donors (Lampe, Fletcher, Stober, Cohen, Jones) immediately

**Expected Impact:** +850 retained donors/year, +$500K-$800K in preserved giving

### Strategy 2: Commerce-to-Donor Bridge
**Objective:** Convert 2,000 of 27,533 non-donor buyers to first-time givers within 12 months

**Actions:**
- "Did you know we're a nonprofit?" messaging in post-purchase flow
- "True Girl Freedom Partner" $15/month ask in product packaging and digital delivery
- VIP buyer (20+ orders) personal "Your True Girl Story" cultivation
- A/B test: product receipt with giving ask vs separate cultivation email
- Track buyer → donor conversion as a core KPI

**Expected Impact:** 2,000 new donors × $62 avg first gift = $124K year 1, growing with retention

### Strategy 3: Tour-to-Donor Funnel
**Objective:** Convert 5% of tour attendees to donors

**Actions:**
- Pre-tour: "Meet the ministry" content series
- At-event: text-to-give opportunity with matching gift
- Post-tour Day 3: Thank-you + "Your daughter's experience was made possible by donors"
- Post-tour Day 14: First gift ask with specific program impact
- Post-tour Day 30: "Freedom Partner" recurring ask

**Expected Impact:** 5% of 10,000 attendees = 500 new donors/season × $62 = $31K/season, growing with retention

### Strategy 4: Subscription Box 2.0 Relaunch
**Objective:** Rebuild to 1,500 active subscribers within 12 months

**Actions:**
- New billing platform (not dependent on Keap payment tokens)
- Tiered pricing: $12/month digital, $25/month physical, $39/month physical + monthly giving
- "Founding Member" campaign to 6,337 former subscribers
- Post-tour upsell (8,381 people with post-tour box sale tags)
- Target TG Power Pack (31,297) as primary acquisition audience

**Expected Impact:** 1,500 subs × $25 avg × 12 = $450K/year + donor acquisition through bundled giving tier

### Strategy 5: Major Gift Program Launch
**Objective:** Secure $500K in new major gifts within 24 months

**Actions:**
- Assign or hire a Major Gift Officer (even part-time)
- Build cultivation pipeline for 29 Ultra High + 114 Very High prospects
- Personal visits to top 20 capacity-gap prospects (Westbury, Buller, Wood, Hayden, Bergey)
- Ministry tour/behind-the-scenes experience
- Target 118 check writers ($12,384 avg) as the natural major gift pool

**Expected Impact:** 5 gifts at $50K+ avg = $250K year 1, building to $500K+ year 2

### Strategy 6: Mid-Level Donor Development
**Objective:** Grow $1K-$10K tier from 678 to 1,000 donors

**Actions:**
- "Ministry Circle" giving society ($1K+/year) with exclusive content and early tour access
- Monthly giving ladder: $84/month = $1K/year threshold
- Targeted upgrade asks to $500-$999 donors showing high engagement (30+ tags)

**Expected Impact:** 322 new mid-level donors × $2,500 avg = $805K in new annual giving

### Strategy 7: Bible Study & Content Giving Integration
**Objective:** Build giving pathways into all content experiences

**Actions:**
- "Scholarship gift" option at study registration: "Add $15 to sponsor another family"
- End-of-study "go deeper" message with giving ask
- B2BB-specific giving fund: "Put Bibles in Brave Girls' Hands"
- Cross-promote between study participants and subscription box

**Expected Impact:** 500 study-driven gifts/year × $50 avg = $25K initial, growing with launches

### Strategy 8: Data Quality & Infrastructure
**Objective:** Clean data foundations to enable all other strategies

**Actions:**
- Normalize state data (TX→Texas, FL→Florida, etc.)
- Match 3,474 unlinked Stripe customers by email
- Classify 1.8M NULL tag_group assignments
- Append phone numbers for top 5,000 contacts (donors + VIP buyers)
- Implement communication logging across all channels
- Recover 126 lost recurring donors not migrating to Givebutter ($61K/year)

**Expected Impact:** Enables accurate segmentation, geographic targeting, and multi-channel outreach

## CLOSING ASSESSMENT

Pure Freedom Ministries has built an extraordinary ecosystem of **84,507 people** who care about discipling tween girls and equipping moms. The True Girl brand reaches 64,569 people. Tours draw 10,000-18,000 per season. Bible studies engage 20,000-37,000 per campaign. Commerce serves 33,694 active buyers.

**The ministry's core challenge is not reach — it's monetization across streams.**

The data reveals a ministry that has mastered audience building through content, tours, and digital marketing but has not built the bridges between streams:
- **No bridge from commerce to giving** → 27,533 buyers who never donated
- **No bridge from tours to giving** → Tours feed engagement, not revenue
- **No bridge from content to giving** → 39,890 deeply engaged people at 7.7% donor rate
- **No bridge from subscription to giving** → 4,987 subscribers who never donated
- **No bridge from wealth screening to cultivation** → $58M capacity, no major gift program

The seven highest-leverage actions are:
1. **Stabilize top donors** — Personal contact with the 6 at-risk top-10 donors ($1.65M cooling + $203K lapsed)
2. **Build buyer-to-donor bridge** — Target 27,533 non-donor buyers with first-gift asks
3. **Build tour-to-donor funnel** — Convert 5% of 10,000+ attendees per season
4. **Relaunch subscriptions** — 6,337 former subscribers are still in the database
5. **Launch major gift program** — $58M in untapped capacity, 118 check writers averaging $12,384
6. **Close the engagement cliff** — Build mid-funnel giving pathway for 39,890 people at 31-100 tags
7. **Fix data foundations** — Stripe matching, tag taxonomy, state normalization, communication logging

The audience is built. The data is unified. The capacity exists. What's needed now is **strategic bridge-building between streams** and **systematic conversion at every touchpoint**.
